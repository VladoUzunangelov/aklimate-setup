    Steps (Ubuntu 18.04) 

        Some Ubuntu prelims 

            https://askubuntu.com/questions/187888/what-is-the-correct-way-to-completely-remove-an-application 

         

        This is to be converted into a script for Docker environment setup later on 

        Setup ssh key – you are using the private one on your end 

        sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade; 

        Install X11 (GUI) - only for VM instances, not for docker containers 

            Sudo apt xorg 

            Install gdm3 – not really necessary (this is desktop GUI) 

            Need to install virtual X11 for R 

                https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/31283/error-in-r-unable-to-open-connection-to-x11 

                    If you don't have any local X server, you can install the virtual framebuffer X11 server like said here: 

                    Sudo apt-get install xvfb xauth xfonts-base 

                    Then you can start a new instance like said here: 

                    Xvfb :0 -ac -screen 0 1960x2000x24 & 
                      

                    Then if your R is compiled with with-x configuration option (enabled by default), you should have X11 capability, and you just have to declare this in R: 

                    Sys.setenv("DISPLAY"=":0") 
                      

             

        Install emacs 

            Setup spacemacs for quick use 

                Clone the spacemacs repo 

                    https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs 

                    Then make it .emacs.d with a symlink 

                Set up the right layers 

                    Copy .spacemacs file from arch home to wherever 

                    Also copy .screenrc 

                 

        Mount disk space with data/ where writing will occur 

            Install sshfs 

            Add mount_remotes.sh and unmount_remotes.sh 

        Install necessary stuff 

            R-base 

                First install libopenblas-base!! 

                    More info on BLAS/LAPACK in Ubuntu 

                        https://wiki.debian.org/DebianScience/LinearAlgebraLibraries 

                     

                    Actually it did not work with openblas – for some reason the matrix computations were quite slow!! 

                        Need to figure this out at some point!! 

                     

                    Switched to ATLAS – that worked reasonably fast (similar to what is on plaza, but using Rcpp in Spicer) 

                        Install libatlas-base-dev,libatlas-cpp-0.6-dev 

                    Mkl produces very similar results (just a smidgeon faster than ATLAS) 

                        Found a great way to install mkl 

                            https://github.com/eddelbuettel/mkl4deb 

                            They should make that into an aur arch package 

                    You can use sudo update-alternatives --config libblas.so.3-x86_64-linux-gnu  

                To switch between alternative BLAS/LAPACK implementations 

                    See https://www.r-bloggers.com/for-faster-r-use-openblas-instead-better-than-atlas-trivial-to-switch-to-on-ubuntu/ 

                    Need to update it for libblas.so-x86_64-linux-gnu,libblas.so.3-x86_64-linux-gnu,liblapack.so.3-x86_64-linux-gnu,liblapack.so-x86_64-linux-gnu 

                Also need to install libcurl4-openssl-dev for curl R package later on!! 

                Need libssl-dev for devtools R package as well 

                Libxml2-dev needed for mlr package 

            R packages 

                c("foreach","doParallel","ranger","plyr","abind","ROCR","caret","proxy","purrr","pracma","fastmatch","devtools","mlr","e1071","igraph") 

                Still create a personal library in ~ 

                    First time you use install.packages, it will ask you and create a default library 

                Install Similarity from my fork  and ComplexHeatmap from bioconductor
